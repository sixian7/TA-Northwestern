\uline{EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS}: Q1 submit graph and R script; Q2 submit your R script only
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create line charts for the following three functions on the same set
of axes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $y=sin(x)$ for $x$ between $-4$ and 4.
\item $y=x^{2}$ for $x$ between $-2$ and 2.
\item $y=\begin{cases}
1 & \text{ if }0\leq x\leq3\\
0 & \text{ if }-3\leq x<0
\end{cases}$
\end{enumerate}

For function (a) use red color and line type ``l''; for function
(b) use green color and line type ``p'' and for function (c) use
blue color and line type ``o''. Include a title and a legend to
your plot (Hint: use function legend()).

\item In the lab session, we used aov() for one-way ANOVA analysis. Please write your own one-way ANOVA function in R which takes two vectors (i.e. data and group labels) as input and the F-test result (e.g. reject null hypothesis or not) as output. You don't have to output the entire ANOVA table. 
\end{enumerate}
